# free-music-plz
A project that just plays F/OSS (Creative Commons) music

## Implementation and Functionality

1. Bot could scan through royalty-free music sites, then insert songs (through ID, or another identifier) into a sequential queue, ordered by a variety of desired metrics (ex: amount of times played, preference, etc).
2. Bot then would play the queue in the user's desired platform: (Discord, OBS, etc).
3. Extra Feature: manual control/skipping of songs.
